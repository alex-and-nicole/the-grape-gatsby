# What is The Grape Gatsby?

*The Grape Gatsby* is a web application developed by Nicole Wu and Alex Rodriguez in 2021 as a pair-programming project assigned to them while attending the Juno College Web Development Immersive Bootcamp. 

At its core *The Grape Gatsby* utilizes HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript to access and display RESTful API data in a stylish and fun way. Drawing inspiration from Jazz Age aesthetics and the literature of F. Scott Fitzgerald, the app aims to help users plan their dinner soir√©es. Users type the dish or cuisine they plan to enjoy in the provided input and *The Grape Gatsby* displays appropriate wine pairings. The app goes one step further by allowing the users to click on the displayed wine pairings and provides specific product recommendations. 

The app utilizes the Spoonancular API which can be [found here](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).
